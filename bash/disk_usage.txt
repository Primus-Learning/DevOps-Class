Objective:

To create a Bash script that checks the disk usage of a Linux server and sends an email notification to the system administrator if the disk usage exceeds a certain threshold.

Instructions:

Create a new Bash script called "disk_usage_monitor.sh".

Declare a variable called "disk_threshold" and set it to the maximum percentage of disk usage that is allowed before sending an email notification.

Declare a variable called "email_address" and set it to the email address of the system administrator.

Declare a variable called "email_subject" and set it to the subject of the email notification.

Use the "df" command to check the disk usage of the server and store the output in a variable called "disk_usage_output".

Use the "grep" command to extract the percentage of disk usage from the "disk_usage_output" variable and store it in a variable called "disk_usage_percentage".

Use an if statement to check if the "disk_usage_percentage" variable is greater than the "disk_threshold" variable. If it is, send an email notification to the system administrator using the "mail" command.

Use the "mail" command to send an email notification to the system administrator with the following message: "Disk usage has exceeded the threshold of [disk_threshold]%."

Save and run the script.

Set up a cron job to run the script at regular intervals, such as every hour.
