Project Title: Automated Backup Solution

Project Description: In this project, you will be tasked with creating an automated backup solution for a Linux server. The solution should be capable of performing the following actions:

Backup data: You will need to automate the backup of specific directories on the server to a remote storage location (e.g. another server, cloud storage, etc.).

Retention policy: You will need to implement a retention policy that specifies how long backups should be kept before being deleted.

Restoration: You will need to demonstrate the ability to restore data from a backup.

Scheduling: You will need to set up a scheduling mechanism for the backups to occur on a regular basis (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Reporting: You will need to set up a reporting mechanism that provides notifications in the event of a successful or unsuccessful backup.

Deliverables:

A report documenting the backup solution and its configuration
A working backup solution that has been tested and validated
