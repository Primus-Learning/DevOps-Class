Exercise 8: Setting up a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection

Install and configure a VPN server such as OpenVPN or WireGuard on the Linux server.
Configure the VPN server to authenticate users using a user database or LDAP server.
Implement security measures such as TLS encryption, firewall rules, and two-factor authentication to protect the VPN connection.
Test the VPN connection by connecting from a remote location and accessing the server's resources.

Exercise 9: Setting up a secure remote desktop access

Install and configure a remote desktop protocol (RDP) server such as XRDP or TigerVNC on the Linux server.
Configure the RDP server to authenticate users using a user database or LDAP server.
Implement security measures such as encryption, access control, and logging to protect the RDP connection.
Test the remote desktop access by connecting from a remote location and accessing the server's desktop environment.
This chained exercise can help employees gain practical experience in setting up and securing a Linux-based file transfer system, VPN connection, and remote desktop access. It can also help companies improve their remote access capabilities and productivity while maintaining security and compliance.






Exercise 1: Setting up a Linux-based web server

Install a Linux server on a virtual machine or physical server.
Configure the server with basic settings such as hostname, IP address, and firewall rules.
Install and configure a web server such as Apache or Nginx.
Set up a website with static content and test the web server by accessing the website from a web browser.
Implement security measures such as TLS encryption, access control, and log monitoring to protect the web server.

Exercise 2: Setting up a content management system (CMS)

Install and configure a CMS such as WordPress or Drupal on the Linux server.
Configure the CMS to use the web server and set up a new website with dynamic content.
Implement security measures such as access control, regular software updates, and backup to protect the CMS and website.
Test the website by adding new content and features and accessing it from a web browser.

Exercise 3: Setting up a load balancer and high availability

Install and configure a load balancer such as HAProxy or Nginx on a separate Linux server.
Configure the load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple web servers running the CMS.
